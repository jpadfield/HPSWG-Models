# Model Consistency Report

_Generated: 2026-03-07 20:31 UTC_

**Individual model files analysed:** 13  
**Workflow/overview files analysed:** 1  

This report checks consistency of inter-model linking nodes declared in each model's `//subgraph Linked Entities` block. Only declared linked entities are checked -- high-multiplicity classes such as E55 type terms are not flagged unless explicitly declared.

**Status key:**
- ✅ Consistent -- class codes match exactly
- 🔵 Hierarchy match -- related via CRM class hierarchy, confirm intent
- ⚠️ Class mismatch -- classes not related, check required
- ❓ Unknown target -- declared target folder not found in repo
- ⚠ No declaration -- `//links` directive missing, suggestions provided

---

## 1. Per-model link validation

Each model's linked entities are listed with their declared target models and consistency status. Where no `//links` declaration exists, possible targets are suggested based on matching class codes.
